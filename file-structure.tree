🧭 PROJECT MAP — START HERE
===========================

📍 Root Level
(the starting place — not a folder, just “here”)

│
├─ index.html
│   └─ This is the entire website right now.
│      When someone visits the site, THIS file loads.
│
└─ file-structure.tree
    └─ This map. It explains what exists and where future files go.

🧠 HOW TO READ THIS MAP
----------------------

• Lines (│ ├ └) show relationships  
• Indentation means “inside” or “belongs to”
• If two files line up vertically, they are in the SAME place
• Right now, everything lives at the root level

🧱 WHAT “ROOT LEVEL” MEANS (VERY IMPORTANT)
-------------------------------------------

• It is NOT a folder
• It is just the starting location of the project
• Think of it like:
  - the ground
  - the table
  - the place you put things first

If a file is NOT indented under another name,
it lives directly at the root level.

🧭 FUTURE EXPANSION (NOT CREATED YET)
-------------------------------------

When you add folders later, they will look like this:

📍 Root Level
│
├─ index.html
└─ public/
    └─ (things placed inside this folder will be indented here)

If it’s indented → it’s inside  
If it’s not indented → it’s at the root
