Current Minimal Portal Structure

📁 public/
│   index.html          # Landing page for Portal
│   uberman.html        # Uberman tracker page
│   file-structure.tree # THIS file documenting the structure
│
└─ js/
    uberman.js         # JS logic for Uberman tracker: PIN unlock, awake hours, notes

server.js              # Node server to handle private PIN unlock
.env                   # Environment variables (PIN, other keys in future)

Notes:

- Folder / File Relationships:
    - Files in /js/ are inside the js folder.
    - server.js and .env live in the root, controlling backend and environment.
    - index.html, uberman.html, and file-structure.tree are in /public/ for browser access.

- Naming Conventions:
    - HTML files = pages users see.
    - JS files = scripts controlling the page behavior.
    - server.js = backend logic.
    - .env = private variables like PIN.

- Color & Style:
    - UI elements will use indigo (third-eye indigo) as main color.

- Readability:
    - ASCII tree preserves indentation.
    - Beginner-friendly: see which files belong in which folders.
    - Developer-friendly: easy to expand into a full social media platform later.

- Future Expansion:
    - Add more HTML pages, JS files, or folders (like /api/) and keep the same tree style.
