/* ===================================================
   PORTAL — STYLESHEET (NOT ACTIVE YET)
   ---------------------------------------------------
   This file does NOTHING right now.

   It is here so:
   • GitHub can create the folder
   • We have a safe place for styles later
   • Nothing breaks

   When we are ready, index.html will
   LINK to this file.

   Until then:
   • Comments only
   • No real CSS
